long_description: >
    Linux Administrator and Open Source consultant with experience in most flavors of modern Linux.  \n
    Proudly Microsoft-free at home, but diplomatically Microsoft-friendly in the office.  \n
    Twelve years experience with Ubutu/Debian and RHEL/CentOS Linux.  I have experience with \n 
    administration, configuration and setup of small and SOHO Linux installations.  \n
    Experienced with managed hosting (inc. Plesk, cPanel) and server support in a data center environment. \n 
    VMWare, HyperV, Ansible, firewalls, SSH, VPNs, server hardening, automation and shell (bash) scripting. \n 
    Adept at integrating Linux and Microsoft Windows servers in an Active Directory environment. \n 
    Spent ten years as a Windows developer and assisted with Microsoft SQL Server Administration. \n
    Experienced with ASP, VBA, VB.NET and windows scripting.  \n\n
    I spent all my time in a terminal window (usually terminator or KiTTY) \n
    and swear that vim is a tool of the gods. \n\n
    If vim isn't available I'll use notepad++ or plain notepad only to wind up with :wq strewn \n
    throughout every page.  \n\n
    I'm interested in computer history and folklore, OSS, automation \n
    and extending, breaking and fixing my .vimrc. \n\n
    You know that one friend that has too many pets because they can't stand to see an animal \n
    without a home?  Yeah, I'm that guy, but with computers.  I enjoy repairing, restoring and re-purposing \n
    broken or out-dated computers and hardware and at any time have three or four machines in \n
    various states of repair.
